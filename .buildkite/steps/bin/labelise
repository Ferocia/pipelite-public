# Usage: labelize NAME CMD [ARG1, ARG2...]
#
# Executes CMD with its arguments and reads the lines from its stdout/stderr.
# Each line is then augmented with "[NAME]", in a pretty ANSI color before
# being displayed in the terminal. This is similar to how tools like foreman
# and docker-compose display their subprocess output.
